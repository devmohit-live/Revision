Thread's shares same heap memory but each thread have it's own stack space

ie. suppose if t1 and t2 are two thread runnign a functions on a class which prints 1 to 10 using loop like this:
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)

now i is a local variable (will be made in stack) so every thrad have it's own copy of i


But what is the function was using an glbal/instance variable of class instead of local variable
say class have a private variable p anf th fx is doing
for(p=10;p>0;i--)

now both the thread are using the same object to call a function so they share the same memory area so same p variable refrence
hence the both will be making chnaes to same p variable
