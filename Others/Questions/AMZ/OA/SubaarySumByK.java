     * We need to track the frequency of the orccurence of remainder of the

     * are divisible by k, and hence the subarray between these two adds to the
     * solution.
     * 
     * 1. Keep getting the cumulative sum
     * 
     * 2. Calculate the remainder and add K to it if it is negative
     * 
     * 3. If the remainder has occured before, it means anything between these two,
     * plus the number of times the remainder came before, those many sub arrays are
     * divisible by k. So add the already seen frequency to the response
     * 
     * 4. Update the frequency now and continue
     * 
     * Note: 0 is seen once in the beginning, ie, when no element is added in
     * cumSum, cumSum = 0 and so 0 has to initialize with frequency 1
